# Hangman
Little hangman game I made for my data structures class

A hangman game that is played through the command prompt via a text visualization of the hangman board. 
Player has to guess the hidden word letter by letter. When the letter guessed is correct the game will fill
in the corresponding hidden letters. When the letter guessed is wrong a new board will be printed to the command
prompt with the updated ascii-drawing of the hangman.
